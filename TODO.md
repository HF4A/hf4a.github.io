## SHOWXATING
- [x] Snap a picture mode, when held over multiple cards, allows you to go back to seat and flip cards at your leisure.
- [x] Change the style of the card catalog to match belter theme
- [x] Start on dynamic, then open card catalog.  Have a setting to determine which displays when app is open.
- [x] Add a button to SYS to reset to "factory settings" but say it in a fun belter way.  after a confirmation, this clears local state storage, forces browser reload, and thus shows the welcome screen again.
- [x] Confirm that diagnostic pack includes actual images in slots, not just URLs.
- [x] Slots shouldn't display when no scan in them.
- [x] Add version to first time welcome screen.  
- [ ] match on text extraction + image match.
- [ ] change blow the airlock to wipe the core
- [ ] when polishing, make sure scanning shows as least briefly, maybe stagger a bit so they don't all MATCH at the same time, or show SCANNING - MATCH - then load card overlay, with a perceptable but still snappy-feeling delay to let the user know that is happening.
- [ ] Update SYS stats on number of manual corrections
- [x] keep a limited depth set of logs, add a logs display button to SYS page that shows them in a very Belter space ship system looking way
- [ ] move version number to bottom under 'okey let's go' button, small and unobtrusive, next to the beratna quote (not another line)
- [ ] Show the first time welcome screen to users on middle number version update (0.2.7 to 0.3.0 for example)
- [ ] Belter / HF4A inspired favicon?
- [ ] the back-side card is backwards!

## Simplified First Launch
- [x] On first launch, have a scrollable welcome screen, explaining the app's purpose and how to use, possibly with simple low-res mockups of the screen, in language that is sprinkled with Belta Creole but understandable for the most part, sasa ke?

## Demo Video
- [ ] on first launch, welcome screen, play embedded video.  I'll record a quick walkthrough on iphone, move it into project directory, have Claude make a time-stamped Belta infused transcript, and then have elevenlabs narrate using this dialect: “Working-class spacefaring accent inspired by Lang Belta.  Light Caribbean cadence, Eastern European consonant hardness, pragmatic tone, restrained emotion.”

## Beyond
- [ ] after making sure basic app works, create a series of crew cards inspired by the TV show "The Expanse", complete with images.
