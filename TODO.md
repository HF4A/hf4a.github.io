## SHOWXATING
- [ ] Snap a picture mode, when held over multiple cards, allows you to go back to seat and flip cards at your leisure.
- [ ] Change the style of the card catalog to match belter theme
- [ ] Start on dynamic, then open card catalog.  Have a setting to determine which displays when app is open.

## Demo Video
- [ ] on first launch, welcome screen, play embedded video.  I'll record a quick walkthrough on iphone, move it into project directory, have Claude make a time-stamped Belta infused transcript, and then have elevenlabs narrate using this dialect: “Working-class spacefaring accent inspired by Lang Belta.  Light Caribbean cadence, Eastern European consonant hardness, pragmatic tone, restrained emotion.”

## Beyond
- [ ] after making sure basic app works, create a series of crew cards inspired by the TV show "The Expanse", complete with images.
